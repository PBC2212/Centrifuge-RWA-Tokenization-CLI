🔑 1. Wallet Setup

You need an Ethereum wallet (Metamask, Safe, Ledger, etc.).

Fund it with CFG (for Centrifuge chain) and ETH (for bridging & gas).

👉 Since you’re building a CLI, you’ve already got wallet generation/encryption in place (.wallets/wallet.json). Make sure that wallet is funded.

🌉 2. Bridge to Centrifuge

Centrifuge runs on its own parachain (CFG) in the Polkadot ecosystem.

To interact with borrowing pools, you’ll need CFG tokens for transaction fees.

Bridge some ETH or DAI/USDC from Ethereum/Polygon → Centrifuge via the Centrifuge Bridge.

Example: Move USDC from Ethereum to Centrifuge chain, so it can be used in pools.

🏛️ 3. Pool Selection

Centrifuge doesn’t allow you to just borrow anywhere — you must borrow through a specific pool.

Pools are created by Asset Originators (AOs) who onboard RWAs (invoices, real estate, etc.).

To borrow, you:

Tokenize your RWA (mint an NFT that represents your asset, e.g., an invoice).

Submit that NFT as collateral to a pool that supports your asset type.

The pool investors provide DAI/USDC liquidity → you borrow against it.

📄 4. RWA Tokenization (Critical)

This is the entry point for borrowers:

You create an NFT on Centrifuge chain that represents your real-world asset.

The NFT is stored in the Centrifuge chain’s Unique Asset Registry.

That NFT becomes your collateral in the pool.

Your CLI will need to implement:

mint-rwa-nft → creates the tokenized asset.

submit-collateral → locks the NFT in the pool.

💵 5. Borrowing Stablecoins

Once collateral is deposited, you can:

Call the pool’s smart contract → borrow DAI/USDC.

Funds are bridged to Ethereum (because Centrifuge liquidity comes from MakerDAO/other investors).

Repayment is also done through the pool, and your collateral is released after full repayment.

✅ 6. Compliance / KYC

Centrifuge is regulated, meaning borrowers must complete KYC with the Asset Originator (AO).

In practice:

You apply to borrow via a pool’s AO.

After approval, your wallet is whitelisted → only then you can borrow.

This is a mandatory off-chain step before your CLI can “actually” execute borrowing transactions.

🚀 So your roadmap:

Fund wallet with CFG (for tx fees).

Bridge stablecoins (USDC/DAI) into Centrifuge.

Onboard asset (via NFT minting in Centrifuge chain).

Apply to a borrowing pool (KYC + AO approval).

Deposit NFT as collateral.

Borrow stablecoins (USDC/DAI).

Manage repayment and release collateral.
