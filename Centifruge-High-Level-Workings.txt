🔑 How Centrifuge Works (high-level)

Asset onboarding (off-chain + on-chain):

A borrower pledges a real-world asset (like an invoice, property, etc).

This asset is tokenized into an NFT (ERC-721) on the Centrifuge chain.

Collateralization (Tinlake / Centrifuge Pools):

That NFT is locked in a Centrifuge pool smart contract.

The pool provides collateralized debt positions (CDPs) against that NFT.

Liquidity provision:

Pools are funded by DeFi liquidity (DAI, USDC, USDT) coming from protocols like MakerDAO or directly from lenders.

Once your NFT is locked, you can borrow stablecoins against its appraised value.

Repayment & liquidation:

Borrowers repay with interest.

If default happens, the NFT collateral (and the underlying RWA) can be liquidated.

⚙️ For Your Platform (Centrifuge-RWA-Tokenization-CLI)

Right now, your CLI simulates step 1 (pledging assets into a local DB).
To actually connect to Centrifuge and enable borrowing, you’d need to:

1. Deploy NFTs for pledged RWAs

Each pledged asset in your DB should be minted as an ERC-721 NFT on Centrifuge (or even Sepolia for testing).

That NFT becomes the on-chain representation of your RWA.

2. Integrate with Centrifuge Pools (Tinlake smart contracts)

Centrifuge pools are deployed smart contracts (ERC-20 + collateral manager).

You’d need your CLI to connect to the pool contracts via ethers.js / web3.js.

Function calls:

lockNFT(nftId) → locks your NFT as collateral.

borrow(amount, stablecoin) → borrows DAI/USDT against your NFT.

repay(amount) → repays borrowed amount with interest.

3. Stablecoin source (DAI/USDT)

On Ethereum mainnet, DAI typically comes from MakerDAO vaults.

In Centrifuge’s case, the pool contract mints a pool token (TIN/DROP), backed by incoming liquidity, and distributes DAI/USDC to the borrower.

On Sepolia/testnet → you could use mock ERC-20s for DAI/USDT.

4. Bridge CLI → Centrifuge chain

Centrifuge has its own chain (Substrate/Polkadot), bridged to Ethereum.

To borrow in practice, your platform would:

Mint NFT on Centrifuge chain.

Bridge it to Ethereum pool.

Execute borrowing via Ethereum smart contracts.

🔮 Your Next Step

To get borrowing working in your CLI, you’d add a command like:

npm run borrow-asset -- --assetId <uuid> --amount 1000 --token DAI


That command would:

Look up the pledged asset in your DB.

Ensure it’s minted as an NFT on-chain (ERC-721).

Call the Centrifuge/Tinlake pool contract’s borrow() method.

Send DAI/USDT to the borrower’s wallet.

👉 So in essence:

Your DB → NFT → Pool contract → Stablecoin liquidity.

The CLI is the UI layer.

Centrifuge provides the pool contracts + liquidity sources.
